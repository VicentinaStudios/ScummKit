/// A utility class for printing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure.
///
/// The `ASTPrinter` class provides methods to traverse an AST and generate a human-readable string representation
/// of its structure. It implements the `ExpressionVisitor` protocol to define behavior for different expression types.
///
/// Example Usage:
/// ```swift
/// let astPrinter = ASTPrinter()
/// if let expression = //... create or obtain an expression ... {
///     if let printedAST = astPrinter.print(expression: expression) {
///         print(printedAST)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
